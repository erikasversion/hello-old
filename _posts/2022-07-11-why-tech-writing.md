# Why Tech Writing

Technical writing combines my interest in technology, my skill at writing clear, useful content, and my knowledge of learning.

At this stage of my carrer, I want to challenge myself in new ways and work in a collaborative environment.

## Career

For over a decade, I've worked in New York City as a tutor for students Grades 3 - 12. Since 2014, I have worked independently, building relationships with clients and strategic partners.

I coach students to increase test scores by over 25% from baseline by designing and developing personalized learning programs that integrate skills, goal-setting, and mindfulness.

I inform students, parents, and educators on processes, strategies, and news relevant to their goals through writing and designing a website, blog, and email newsletter.

My students have various levels of knowledge, skills, and experience.

Work on the SAT and ACT has perfected my knowledge of grammar and sentence mechanics.


## Education

I have a BAs in English and Psychology from Georgetown University in Washington, DC and am a member of Phi Beta Kappa. 


## Additional Experience

In 2020, I created a book-focused Instagram account. Today, it has over 9,000 followers.

In conjunction with the Instagram account, I started a curated Amazon storefront featuring discounted ebooks. My storefront has generated $159,373.44 of shipped item revenue YTD.

In 2022, I strengthened user engagement through launching a Patreon community. Member bonuses include a *Kindle 101* ebook with how-to guides and explanations to empower users to get the most of their Kindles.
